$resource service. (You can use the $http service to work with a RESTful API, but doing so means you 
have to expose the complete set of URLs that are used to perform operations throughout the application. 
You can do this by defining a service that performs the operations for you, but a more elegant 
alternative is to use the $resource service, defined in the optional ngResource module, which 
also has a nice way of dealing with defining the URLs that are used to send requests to the server.
